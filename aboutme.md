I'm Xinyuan Zhu, a first-year graduate student at University of Science and Technology of China ([UTSC](https://ustc.edu.cn/)) since 2021. Now I work as a Research Assistant in Lab for Data Science ([LDS](http://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/)). My research interests include causal inference, data mining and the interdisciplinary field of biomedicine and machine learning.

I obtained my B.Eng degree in **Information Security** at School of the Gifted Young ([SGY](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/)), USTC in 2021. Moreover, I graduated from the Talent Program for Artificial Intelligence at USTC in 2021.
